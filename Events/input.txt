The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
At the touch of love, everyone becomes a poet.
To be or not to be, that is the question.
In the end, we only regret the chances we didn't take.
Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans.
The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.
The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.
Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds that you plant.
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light.
